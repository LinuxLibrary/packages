# JVCS (Java Services)

- JSVC is a wrapper to launch Java applications as daemons under UNIX. It's a part of commons daemon.

- Compiled jsvc binaries (for Linux and Darwin platforms) are packaged with the gem, unfortunately they seem not to be working for all
- As a last resort in such cases we recommend compiling the binary from source, or installing it using your distribution's package manager if a fairly recent version is provided and maintained.
